## Overview
This repository contains a collection of template codes for various regression models in machine learning. These templates serve as starting points and provide a structured foundation for implementing regression algorithms in your projects.

## Features
- Templates for popular regression algorithms:
    - ### Linear regression
    - ### Multiple regression
    - ### Polynomial regression
    - ### Support vector regression (SVR)
    - ### Decision tree
    - ### Random forest regression
    
- Sample datasets included
- Clear instructions and code comments for easy understanding
- Python code snippets

## Usage
1. Clone the repository using the following command: git clone https://github.com/your-username/regression-model-templates.git

2. Navigate to the desired template directory.

3. Open the template code in your preferred Python editor or IDE.

4. Follow the instructions and modify the code according to your specific use case.

5. Run the code to train and evaluate the regression model using the provided sample dataset or replace it with your own data.

6. Experiment with different hyperparameters and explore customization options.

7. Integrate the template code into your machine learning project.
